    <p>In addition to providing the foregoing information to our partners, if you choose to correspond further with us through email, we may retain the content of your email messages together with your email address and our responses. We provide the same protections for these electronic communications that we employ in the maintenance of information received by mail and telephone.</p>
    <span>b. Website Use Information</span>
    <p></p>
    <p>When you visit our website, some information is automatically collected. This may include information such as the operating system running on your device, IP address, access time, browser type, language and the website        you visited before our site. We also collect information about how you use our product and services.</p>
    <p>Similar to other commercial Websites, our Website utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What Are Cookies?") and Web server logs to collect information about how our Website is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Website, and the Websites visited just before and just after our Website. This information is collected on an aggregate basis. None of this information is associated with you as an individual.</p>
    <span>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</span>
    <p></p>
    <p>We usually use personal information for the purposes of administering our business activities, providing customer service and making available other products and services to our customers and prospective customers.</p>
    <p>Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our Website, new services and special offers we think you will find valuable. The lists used to send you product and service offers are developed and managed under our traditional corporate standards designed to safeguard the security and privacy of our customers’ personal information.</p>
    <p>As a customer, you will be given the opportunity, through our website, to notify us of your desire not to receive these offers.</p>
    <span>What Are Cookies?</span>
    <p></p>
    <p>Cookies are a feature of Web browser software that allows Web servers to recognize the computer used to access a Website. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user’s Web browser on the user’s hard drive. Cookies can remember what information a user accesses on one Web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that Website by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user’s transactions on related Web pages. This makes it easier for a user to move from Web page to Web page and to complete commercial transactions over the Internet. Cookies should make your online experience easier and more personalized.</p>
    <span>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</span>
    <p></p>
    <p>We use Website browser software tools such as cookies and Web server logs to gather information about our Website users’ browsing activities, in order to constantly improve our Website and better serve our customers. This information assists us to design and arrange our Web pages in the most user- friendly manner and to continually improve our Website to better meet the needs of our customers and prospective customers. Cookies help us collect important business and technical statistics. The information in the cookies lets us trace the paths followed by users to our Website as they move from one page to another. Web server logs allow us to count how many people visit our Website and evaluate our Website’s visitor capacity. We do not use these technologies to capture your individual email address or any personally identifying information about you although they do permit us to send focused online banner advertisements or other such responses to you.</p>
    <span>Sharing Information with Affiliates:</span>
    <p></p>
    <p>From time to time you may notice offers from outside companies advertised on our Website. We take measures to select product or service providers that are responsible and afford privacy protections to their customers. However, we cannot make any representations about the practices and policies of these companies.</p>
    <span>Sharing Information with Strategic Partners:</span>
    <p></p>
    <p>We may enter into strategic marketing alliances or partnerships with third parties who may be given access to personal information including your name, address, telephone number and email for the purpose of providing you information regarding products and services that we think will be of interest to you. In connection with strategic marketing alliances or partnerships, we will retain all ownership rights to the information, and we will not share information regarding your social security number or other personal financial data.</p>
    <span>Changes to the Policy and New Services:</span>
    <p></p>
    <p>We may change this policy from time to time. If we make any changes to this policy, we will change the last updated date above. You agree that your continued use of our services after such changes have been published to our services will continue your acceptance of such revised policy.</p>
    <span>How Do We Secure Information Transmissions?</span>
    <p></p>
    <p>We use Razorpay as our payment gateway. We do not collect any credit card information other than that provided to us through Razorpay letting us know who successfully used their credit card on our site. Other email that you may send to us may not be secure unless we advise you that security measures will be in place prior to your transmitting the information. For that reason, we ask that you do not send confidential information such as Social Security or account numbers to us through an unsecured email.</p>
    <span>How Do We Protect Your Information?</span>
    <p></p>
    <p>We take due care to protect customer data. Technical measures are in place to prevent unauthorized or unlawful access to the data and against accidental loss, or destruction of, or damage to, data.</p>
    <span>Is there evaluation of Information Protection Practices?</span>
    <p></p>
    <p>Periodically, our operations and business practices are reviewed for compliance with corporate policies and procedures governing the security, confidentiality and quality of our information. Our corporate values, ethical standards, policies and practices are committed to the protection of customer information. In general, our business practices limit employee access to confidential information, and limit the use and disclosure of such information to authorized persons, processes and transactions.</p>
    <span>How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?</span>
    <p></p>
    <p>You may request access to all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain in our database by sending a request mail at Turshaadi@gmail.com.</p>
    <span>Do We Disclose Information to Outside Parties?</span>
    <p></p>
    <p>We may provide aggregate information about our customers, sales, Website traffic patterns and related Website information to our affiliates or reputable third parties, but this information will not include personally identifying data, except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <span>What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?</span>
    <p></p>
    <p>We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights</p>
    <span>What About Other Websites Linked to Our Website?</span>
